# CS:APP assignment 5.18
`Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective`

This is formerly an assignment to optimize the algorithm shown in practice 5.5 and 5.6. We attempt to use the methods introduced in chapter 5 to attain minimum CPE. And now we made this repo a basic benchmarking program which will run through every test cases consisting of different loop unrolling and loop splitting method, and will give a result on which of the method is the best depending on your machine.

## We require your help :D

Please kindly run this program the default way and copy the result to this markdown website [here]().

## Dependencies

For performance measurement, you must have the package `cpupower` installed in your machine. For instances, run the below command on Ubuntu:
```
$ sudo apt install linux-tools-common
```
and then check the other package needed (machine wise so we can't list them here) and install them. Mostly are linux kernel tools.

We use **gnuplot** to plot the performance comparison graph. So you need it installed in your system.
```
$ sudo apt install gnuplot
```

## Running the test
